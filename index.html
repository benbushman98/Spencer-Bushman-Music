                <p>Spencer is a lover of the arts. Sports, literature, and music has driven his 
                    life from the very beginning, much due to his parents love of similar passions.
                </p>
                <p>Spencer's father enjoys sports and the pop/rock side of music and his mother
                    enjoys literature, writing and the classical side of music. From a very young
                    age, Spencer's life has been influenced by music.
                </p>
                <p>With a presence in both his junior high and high school choirs, that love of music has grown into a love of
                    piano, which is one of his favorite aspecs of music, to composing and writing 
                    his own songs. These passions have fueled his past, the present, and will affect 
                    his future. TEST
